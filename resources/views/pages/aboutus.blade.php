    <h2> About us</h2>
    <p>
        Based on the report from United Nations, 
        there is one-third of food is wasted globally which create 44 tons of carton emission each year. 
        Food waste does not only result in financial lost for operators, but deteriorate the global warming crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
        In normal hotels/snack bars/restaurants/bakeries, 
        operators would prepare enough choices in menu and avoid the sold-out situation that may cause bad feelings for customers.
        In addition to normal used amount, there is also additional prepared food material. 
        However, when the consumption and used amount is not as expectation, 
        or some food can only be used for one day, the left food which still can be eaten will be scrapped and become leftover.
    </p>
        <p>Each of us has little power to make change around us.
        However, when the little power of every one is gathered, the change can be enormous.
        As we can see a lot of food around us is wasted every day, 
        this does not only create the food waste problem but make restaurants/hotels/shops hard to process these food.
        While there are still unimaginable amount of people should resist hunger for the financial issue or other reasons,    
        why not provide a chance for those who want to save those food which is near expiration time? </p>
    <p>
        Just a "share" action. You can make huge change.
        No matter what intention for anyone who is willing to join our action is, 
        we welcome each of you to become a food hero with us.</p>
